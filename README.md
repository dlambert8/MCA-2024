# Music Curation Project
## Week 1 Musical Datasets
Task 2: I have identified Disclosure as my particular artist of analysis for my project, and more specifically the song Holding On (featuring Gregory Porter). Audio recordings and metadata have been easy to find and are available on multiple websites. The more difficult aspect was to find musical scores for the work, however I found them on www.sheetmusicdirect.com. This website provides digital notation music for the vocal jazz in this song.

Task 3: Based on my experience earlier of attempting to work with music related data, I found it difficult particularly in the access aspect. This is more directed towards the musical sheets, as the specific artists I was looking for could only be found on subscription and purchase-based websites. This does make the music harder to access, as I am requiring to pay in order to find the specific information I need. My selected theme somewhat displays this, as I am only able to access the vocal jazz element of this song and not the other instruments that are also present. The current manifestations of data relate to this issue, as in a lot of cases data is not as freely accessible as it should be. Individuals could face struggle in attempting to gather information which is being witheld from them due to profitability reasons and this is particularly unfair.
