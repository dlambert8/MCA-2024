# Music Curation Project
## Week 1: Musical Datasets
Task 2: I have identified Allesandro Amato as my particular artist of analysis for my project, and more specifically the song Adea. Audio recordings and metadata have been easy to find and are available on multiple websites. This sheet music was relatively easy to find thanks to IMSLP.org. This website provides digital notation music for the piano played in this song.
Here is an uploaded photo of the music that I transcribed.

Task 3: Based on my experience earlier of attempting to work with music related data, I found it difficult particularly in the access aspect. This is more directed towards the musical sheets, as the other artists I was looked at, which were in bands as opposed to classical composers, could only be found on subscription and purchase-based websites. This makes the music harder to access, as I am requiring to pay in order to find the specific information I need. The current manifestations of data relate to this issue, as in a lot of cases data it is not as freely accessible as it should be. Individuals could face struggle in attempting to gather information which is being witheld from them due to profitability reasons and this is unfair.
## Week 2: Using MuseScore
The OMR engine did not properly transcribe the time singatures. On the original sheet music they were set at 5/8, however MuseScore translated this as 3/4. Beat rests, articulations, tempos and row numbers have all been added to the sheet based on pure assumption. Separation of the notes have also changed. Essentially a whole different music piece has been created from the upload of my original sheet.
## Week 3:
The MusicXML file has a variety of different elements compared to the MEI files. For example the MusicXML file has over 600,000 characters as opposed to my MEI file which is at just 300,000 characters. The MEI files provide each note with an ID, unlike MusicXML. This would definitely be helpful if a musical sheet does not have a distinctive title. The rest element in MEI is also much more simple, only including a duration attribute on the same line, whereas the MusicXML file requires several lines for duration, voice and type. MEI files also keeps the note element on one single line with the attributes of dots, dur, oct, pname and stem.dir. MusicXML's note element however, is much more complicated, taking up multiple lines for each detail such as pitch, step, octave, duration, tie type, voice, type, dot default, stem, staff, beam number, notations and slur type.
