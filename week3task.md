## Week 3: Music XML Files
This is the [Verovio task.](verovio.html)

The MusicXML file has a variety of different elements compared to the MEI files. For example the MusicXML file has over 600,000 characters as opposed to my MEI file which is at just 300,000 characters. The MEI files provide each note with an ID, unlike MusicXML. This would definitely be helpful if a musical sheet does not have a distinctive title. The rest element in MEI is also much more simple, only including a duration attribute on the same line, whereas the MusicXML file requires several lines for duration, voice and type. This because XML files are intended to be both machine readable and human readable. MEI files also keeps the note element on one single line with the attributes of dots, dur, oct, pname and stem.dir. MusicXML's note element however, is much more complicated, taking up multiple lines for each detail such as pitch, step, octave, duration, tie type, voice, type, dot default, stem, staff, beam number, notations and slur type.
