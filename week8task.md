### Task 2: Here are the waveforms and the spectograms for my pieces.

Below me is the waveform-based analysis on Berceuse n. 3 Adea by Alessandro Amato.

Below me here is the time-frequency analysis spectogram for Berceuse n. 3 Adea by Alessandro Amato.

Below me here is the waveform-based analysis for Für Elise, WoO 59 by Ludwig van Beethoven.

Below me here is the time-frequency analysis spectogram for Für Elise, WoO 59 by Ludwig van Beethoven.

Below me is the waveform-based analysis on Piano Sonata No.14, Op.27 No.2 by Ludwig van Beethoven.

Below me is the time-frequency analysis on Piano Sonata No.14, Op.27 No.2 by Ludwig van Beethoven.

![Screenshot 2024-11-15 023841](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bcb2637-d67b-41f1-b019-a6c302548ce8)

One key advantage that time frequency analysis has over a waveform-based analysis is that sounds are analysed as individual components. We can observe this specifically on the spectrograms for Piano Sonata No.14, Op.27 No.2 by Ludwig van Beethoven. As multiple notes are played on the piano throughout this song, the spectrogram individually captures each note and is represented through multiple colours. On the other hand, the waveform-based analysis only captures noise collectively and doesn’t distinguish between individual instruments and notes. As a result, the music data which can be understood from a time frequency analysis is much more detailed.
