## Week 4: jSymbolic and Music21 
### Task 1: JSymbolic Comparison of Two Songs
Here is a [table](week4table.md) for the results in my comparison of musical data in the sheet music Berceuse n. 3 Adea by Alessandro Amato and Right Here, Right Now by Fatboy Slim. 


### Task 2: Music 21 Data Visualisations
Here are the music data visualisations that I generated from inputting cell instructions to Music21 on Jupyter Notebooks.

Below me is the piano roll of pitches for my chosen piece.
