## Week 2: Using MuseScore
The OMR engine did not properly transcribe the time singatures. On the original sheet music they were set at 5/8, however MuseScore translated this as 3/4. Beat rests, articulations, tempos and row numbers have all been added to the sheet based on pure assumption. Separation of the notes have also changed. Essentially a whole different music piece has been created from the upload of my original sheet.
