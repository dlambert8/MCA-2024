## Week 10: Similarity Matrix and Transcription
### Task 1: Generating a Similarity Matrix
Here is the [similarity matrix](https://github.com/dlambert8/MCA-2024/blob/master/week10jupytertask.ipynb) I produced on Jupyter Notebooks for my 3 chosen tracks.

### Task 2: Transcription and Comparison

This is the orginal MuseScore piece.

Upon comparing the images, there are multiple transcription errors with information being lost. To begin with, the first clear losses of detail would be the title and composer name, which are completely erased from the original piece. The metadata is crucial for identifying the song, so losing this is relatively significant. The next fundamental aspect of the piece that has been lost is the tempo markings. In the original it states ♩ = 100, whereas in the transcribed piece it states ♩ = 91, which is a significant deviation from the original. While there are a lot more errors in this piece, the transcribed piece has managed to retain melodic content as well as the overall structure being accurate. Overall, the transcription misses more of the important musical content than what it recaptures. Essentially, I am looking at a whole different piece, as the crucial components listed are completely absent.
