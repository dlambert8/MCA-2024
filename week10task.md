## Week 10: Similarity Matrix and Transcription
### Task 1: Generating a Similarity Matrix
Here is the [similarity matrix](https://github.com/dlambert8/MCA-2024/blob/master/week10jupytertask.ipynb) I produced on Jupyter Notebooks for my 3 chosen tracks.

### Task 2: Transcription and Comparison

This is the orginal MuseScore piece.

When comparing the two pieces, there are multiple errors of important information that is lost. The first clear difference is the metadata (title, composer name and year of publication) at the top of the song, which is not present in the second one. This is relatively significant for identifying the song, so losing this data makes the song hard to distinguish. The tempo notes are also completely inaccurate on the transcribed piece, with the tempo changing from 100 to 91. This will heavily impact the song, as the beats per minute will be completely different. The serenamente tempo note is also not present in the second sheet, which affects the way in which the performer should play the piece. Overall, the transcription misses a lot more of the musical content than what it recaptures. Essentially, I am looking at a whole different piece, as the crucial components listed are completely absent.
