## Week 7: MEI Copyright Licensing
Here is a second version of my MEI file with the updated metadata. I have now added the metadata of genre classifications and a creative commons license, as we can see in the highlighted yellow. Once again here is the link to the mei file [I added this to](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlambert8/MCA-2024/refs/heads/master/Adea%20by%20Allesandro%20Amato%20-%20copy-Part_1%20(1).mei)

In terms of genre classifications, I added the details of my genre as modern classical because my piece is of recent decades (2010s) yet is a piano piece with musical properties resembling classical music. I also believe the CC by 4.0 license is the most logical to choose as it accurately gives credit to me, as the creator of this MEI document, whilst also allowing other users to share and build upon the material. This can be seen once I copy the license agreement, where it states that reusers must give credit to the creator whilst allowing reusers to "distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, even for commercial purposes." (Creative Commons, 2024).
